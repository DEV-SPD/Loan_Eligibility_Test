1. DATA EXTRACTION
2. DATA PRE-PROCESSING LIKE DROPPING MISSING VALUES, LABEL ENCODING OF CATEGORICAL VALUES
3. CLUSTERING OUT NECESSARY VARIABLES FOR TRAINING
4. PREPARING DATASET FOR TRAINING THE MODEL
5. TRAINING THE MODEL
6. DUMPING THE MODEL INTO A SINGLE FILE



1. Data Extraction using pandas [pd.read_csv('')].
2. DROPPING ROW WITH NULL VALUES USING dropna.
3. Replaced the categorical values with binary values.
4. Plotted the graphs for identifying which variable affects loan status the most.
5. Prepared the data for training and testing.
6. Made the ML model using support vector machine algorithm.
7. Saved the model into a file using pickle module and named the file as Loan_Eligibility.
